                    <p>On the front end, I'm a fullstack engineer with a knack for design and application development.</p>
                    <p>On the back end, I'm a mom, jazz musician, artist, photographer, scientist, avid runner, and overall nerd. I studied psychology and music at Texas Tech, and then received my second degree at Texas State in biology and biochemistry.</p>
                    <p>At first glance it may seem that my experience and studies are irrelevant to programming, but there are some powerful intersections between technology, art, psychology and medical science that I am really excited to be a part of. 
                        That being said, there's a whole lot that I want to accomplish as an engineer; 
                        my goals are to expand on my current knowledge as a developer and, eventually, forge a path into AI, ML and data science.
